Userscripts for the Tampermonkey extension (mostly for personal use and JavaScript practice)
 
Userscripts are computer programs or scripts used to customize and enhance the functionality of websites or web applications by adding or modifying features and behaviors. Userscripts are typically written in JavaScript and can manipulate the content and behavior of web pages to suit the preferences and needs of the user.
 
Overall, userscripts are a versatile tool for customizing and personalizing the web browsing experience, allowing users to tailor websites to their liking.
 
I really enjoy coming up with and tinkering with pre-existing userscripts that I find on Greasy Fork so I finally decided to start uploading some of them to my github profile.
 
These scripts are tested primarily on Tampermonkey for Chrome and Chromium browsers. As a result, there may be some performance and compatibility issues on Firefox alternatives such as Greasemonkey.

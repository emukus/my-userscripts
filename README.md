# my-userscripts
JavaScript userscripts for the Tampermonkey extension (mostly for personal use and practice)

Userscripts are computer programs or scripts used to customize and enhance the functionality of websites or web applications by adding or modifying features and behaviors. Userscripts are typically written in JavaScript and can manipulate the content and behavior of web pages to suit the preferences and needs of the user.
 
I really enjoy coming up with and tinkering with pre-existing userscripts that I find on Greasy Fork so I finally decided to upload some of them to my github profile.

These scripts are tested primarily on Tampermonkey for Chrome and Chromium browsers. As a result, there may be some performance and compatibility issues on Firefox alternatives such as Greasemonkey.
